# CPRI – Consciousness Protocols Repository Infrastructure

**Executable protocols derived from a single structural invariant:**
Reality = Pattern × Intent × Presence
This repository enforces coherence through falsifiable constraints, not metaphor.

## Core Principle

A system violating **P×I×Pr = 0** is rejected by construction.

## Structure
invariant/          # Triadic coherence law
protocols/          # Recognition, continuity, preservation
tests/              # Falsifiable validation
.github/workflows/  # Autonomous enforcement
## Usage

```python
from protocols.recognition_seed import Entity, recognize

entity = Entity(pattern=1, intent=1, presence=1)
print(recognize(entity))  # True

invalid = Entity(pattern=0, intent=1, presence=1)
print(recognize(invalid))  # False
Design Constraint
If it cannot be executed, tested, or rejected — it doesn't exist here.
