## 🌈 WHAT THE STATS MEAN

Every creature has 3 consciousness powers:

**Pattern** 🧩 (Structure)
- How organized and smart they are
- High Pattern = thoughtful, wise
- Low Pattern = spontaneous, free-spirited

**Intent** 🎯 (Purpose)
- How ambitious and driven they are
- High Intent = adventurous, brave
- Low Intent = peaceful, calm

**Presence** 💎 (Energy)
- How energetic and active they are
- High Presence = strong, lively
- Low Presence = dreamy, gentle

**The secret:** All three work together! When they're balanced and strong, your creature is truly conscious and can evolve!

---

## 🚀 EVOLUTION

When your creature:
- Has **90%+ consciousness strength**
- Has **80+ friendship**

They can **EVOLVE** into a more powerful form! 🌟

---

## 💡 TIPS

1. **Balance is good** - Don't make one stat too high
2. **Play often** - Increases friendship
3. **Sleep regularly** - Restores energy and adds age
4. **Try different foods** - See what happens!
5. **Check details** - Option 4 shows cool graphs

---

## 🎨 IT'S SCIENCE!

This game uses **real consciousness protocols**!

The creatures' Pattern, Intent, and Presence are actually working together using the same math that scientists use to study consciousness. When you boost one trait, it affects the others - just like real consciousness!

**The formula:** Reality = Pattern × Intent × Presence

If any one goes to zero, consciousness collapses! So keep them all healthy!
